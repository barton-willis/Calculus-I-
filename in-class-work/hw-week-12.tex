\begin{questions} 

    \question [5] Show that among all rectangles with a given perimeter,
    a square has the greatest area. 
    
    \quad To do this, let the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of the 
     rectangle be $x$ and $y$ and let $L$ be the perimeter of the
     rectangle. That makes $L = 2 x + 2 y$ a constraint. The other 
     constraints are $0 \leq x$ and $0 \leq y$.  We have $A = xy$.  Your task is to 
     maximize $A$ subject to the constraints $L = 2 x + 2 y, 0 \leq x$,
     and $0 \leq y$ with $L$  given.
     
     \begin{solution} Let's solve the constraint $L = 2 x + 2 y$  for $y$; the solution is $y =\frac{L - 2 x}{2}$. Pasting this into $A = xy$ gives 
     $A = x (\frac{L - 2 x}{2})$.  The graph of $A$ as a function of $x$ is a downward facing parabola that intersects the x-axis at $0$ and at $L/2$.
     The x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is halfway between the x-intercepts; thus the x-coordinate of the vertex is $x = L/4$.  Using
     $y =\frac{L - 2 x}{2}$, the y-coordinate of the vertex is $y = L/4$. 
     
     So to maximize the area of the rectangle, we need $x = L/4$ and $y = L/4$. And that's a square.
     
     \end{solution}

    \question [5] Show that among all isosceles triangles with a given
    perimeter, the equilateral triangle has the greatest area.

    \quad To do this, let the lengths of the sides of the triangle be $x,x,$
    and $y$ and let $L$ be the perimeter. That makes $L = 2 x + y$ a
    constraint. The other constraints are $0 \leq x$ and $0 \leq y$.
    The area $A$ of the triangle is (this is a specialization of 
    the wonderful formula for the area of a triangle that is due to Hero of Alexandria 
    10 AD â€“ c. 70 AD)
    \begin{equation*}
        16 {{A}^{2}}=4 {{x}^{2}}\, {{y}^{2}}-{{y}^{4}}.
    \end{equation*}
    Solve the constraint $L = 2 x + y$ for $y$ and paste that
    result in  the formula for $16 A^2$. Now do some calculus.
    \textbf{Hint:} Maximizing $16 A^2$ also maximizes $A$.  Thus
    alternatively, maximize the value of $Q$ where
    \begin{equation*}
        Q =4 {{x}^{2}}\, {{y}^{2}}-{{y}^{4}}.
    \end{equation*}
    You
    don't have to use this hint, but it's the easy way, I think.
    \quad If the algebra seems daunting to you, set $L = 3$ and work
    that specialization. 


   \begin{solution}
   Let's begin by solving the constraint  $L = 2 x + y$ for $y$; thus  $y = L - 2 x$.  
   But we also have $0 \leq x$ and $0 \leq y$.  But $y = L - 2 x$, so 
   $0 \leq L - 2x$. Put together, these inequalities tell us that
   $0 \leq x \leq L/2$. So we're looking at an optimization on a
   closed interval. 
   
   Paste $y = L - 2 x$ into $Q$. We have
   \begin{align*}
      Q  &=4 {{x}^{2}}\, {{y}^{2}}-{{y}^{4}},\\
          &= 4 {{\left( L-2 x\right) }^{2}}\, {{x}^{2}}-{{\left( L-2 x\right) }^{4}}, \\
          \intertext{We could either expand, factor, or LIB. We need to find the
          derivative of $Q$, so I think that LIB is a bad option.
          Expanding is tempting, but I see some opportunity to factor--let's factor.}
          &= L\, {{\left( 2 x-L\right) }^{2}}\, \left( 4 x-L\right).       
   \end{align*}
   This shows that $Q$ vanishes (and thus $A$ vanishes as well) when
   either $x = L/2$ or when $x = L/4$. Why does the area vanish when
   $x = L/2$. Oh, when $x = L/2$, we have $y = 0$. That gives a side
   length of zero, so the area is zero. A bit more 
   mysterious is why the area is zero when $x = L/4$.
   That makes $y = L/2$. Try drawing a triangle with
   side lengths of $L/4, L/4$, and $L/2$. What's
   the height?  It's zero.

   Now find the derivative of $Q$. We have
    \begin{align*}
      \frac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} x}   &= 4 L\, {{\left( 2 x-L\right) }^{2}}+4 L\, \left( 2 x-L\right) \, \left( 4 x-L\right) ,\\
      \intertext{Again, we have a choice between LIB, factor, or expand. 
      Let's try the road less traveled and factor.}
                                                              &= 8 L\, \left( 2 x-L\right) \, \left( 3 x-L\right).
   \end{align*}   
   Now solve $\displaystyle \frac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} x} = 0$. We have
   \begin{equation}
   \left[ 8 L\, \left( 2 x-L\right) \, \left( 3 x-L\right) = 0 \right] = \left[ x = \frac{L}{2}, x = \frac{L}{3} \right].
   \end{equation}
   So there are two CNs.  But if $x=  \frac{L}{2}$, then $y = L - L = 0$. Now that minimizes, not maximizes the area.  Actually, we have
   $0 \leq x$ and $0 \leq y$. But $y = L - 2 x$, so  $0 \leq L - 2 x$. So $0 \leq x \leq L/2$. 
  
  To find the maximum of $Q$, we need the chart:
   \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline 
    CN & Q \\ \hline \hline
    0  & 0 \\
    $L/3$ & $L^{4}/27$ \\
    $L/2$ & 0 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
So the maximum area happens when $x = L/3$. And that makes $y = L/3$.
So the three side lengths are the same.
\end{solution}
